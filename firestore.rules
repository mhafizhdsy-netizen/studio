/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for GenHPP application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for private data (user profiles and calculations),
 * while allowing public read access to shared calculations. Write access to public calculations is restricted
 * to the owner, enforced via server-side logic.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the authenticated user with matching UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/calculations/{calcId}: Stores calculation history for each user, accessible only by the authenticated user with matching UID.
 * - /public_calculations/{calcId}: Stores publicly shared calculation data, readable by anyone, writable only by the owner.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data and calculations are strictly owned by the authenticated user.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - Public calculations are readable by all, but write-protected.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Calculation' entity includes the 'userId' field to enable ownership validation within the security rules, avoiding the need for additional `get()` calls.
